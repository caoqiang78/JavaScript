syntax: element.childNodes

Use: to manipulate nodes

Tips:
  1. childNodes get any collections from the parent node
      such as: element, content, comment... all are included into the childNodes collection
  
  2. element.childNodes[index], from 0
  
  3. different with element.children is : element.children only collects element, but not text content and comments.
